loggle - syslog watcher/alerter

This is a little C++ program that combines the functionality of
tail -F and grep with a buffer and email. I wrote this so I could get
email alerts when my server got too hot. I was already running lm-sensors
and sensord, but they don't send email. This code is designed to be
lightweight and efficient. It doesn't use the shell and doesn't spawn
processes unless it's sending mail.

The code is loggle.cpp and there is a Makefile.

There's also a Debian-style init script and a defaults file.
